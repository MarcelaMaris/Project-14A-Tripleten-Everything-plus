# 📂 Data Folder

This folder contains the datasets used in the project.

- `samples/` → Contains small sample datasets that can be safely shared.
- `raw/` → (not tracked) Should contain the original raw dataset. **Do not commit large or sensitive files**.

## Notes
The full dataset is stored locally and is not included in the GitHub repository because of size and privacy restrictions.  
If you want to reproduce the analysis, place the file `ecommerce_dataset_us.csv` in the `data/samples` folder.
